# ITP-449-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project
This is my exploratory data analysis project, in which I chose to analyze the Top 2,000 songs on Spotify. 
I built various visualizations of the data, including a pie chart representing the distribution of songs by genre, line charts
chronicling certain metrics over time such as beats per minute and song length, and a bar chart highlighting the average length of the songs
by genre.
